# Inventory and Sales Performance Optimization
## Optimize inventory levels and boost sales through data-driven insights
### Introduction
This project aims to improve how businesses manage their inventory and increase sales performance by analyzing sales data for both retail and warehouse operations by leveraging data analysis techniques. The dataset includes sales data for multiple product types including Liquor, Wine, Beer, Non-Alcoholic beverages, STR_SUPPLIES, Kegs, Dunnage, and Ref. Key analyses were performed to identify trends, forecast demand, and provide actionable recommendations for better inventory management and sales optimization. 
### Project Overview
This project tackled real-world challenges of managing stock levels and optimizing sales strategies for a variety of products like Liquor, Beer, Non-Alcoholic beverages, and more. Here’s a breakdown of what we did:
* Data Collection & Cleaning: We gathered sales and inventory data from multiple channels (retail and warehouse), handled missing data, and standardized the dataset for analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key trends, such as which products were overstocked or underperforming.
* Sales & Inventory Analysis: Segmented the data to find which products were performing well in retail versus warehouse channels.
* Demand Forecasting: Built a demand forecasting model using machine learning to anticipate demand surges and optimize stock levels accordingly.
* Actionable Insights: Provided clear, data-backed recommendations to improve inventory management and sales performance.
### Technologies Used
* Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn): For data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.
* Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory data analysis and reporting.

#### Dataset Description
The dataset contains information on the following:
* Product Types: Liquor, Wine, Beer, Non-Alcoholic beverages, STR_SUPPLIES, KEGS, DUNNAGE, and REF.
* Sales Channels: Retail and Warehouse.
* Sales Metrics: Average sales, total sales, and maximum sales for each product type.
* Timeframe: Sales data from multiple years, including the year 2018, which had an overall drop in sales.
The dataset was cleaned, with missing values handled appropriately, and transformed to derive meaningful insights for sales and inventory management.
### Analysis Process
* Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected data inconsistencies, and standardized the dataset for analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated trends in sales across product types and channels (Retail vs. Warehouse). Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate visual insights.
* Sales Performance Analysis: Analyzed total, average, and maximum sales for each product category.
* Inventory Management Optimization: Identified products with stock imbalances (e.g., overstocked, underperforming, or out-of-stock items).
* Recommendations: Provided actionable insights on how to adjust stock levels and optimize sales strategies for future success.
### Key Findings
* High-Performing Products: Beer had consistently high average, maximum, and total sales in the warehouse.
*	Underperforming Products: Items like DUNNAGE, STR_SUPPLIES, and KEGS showed negative or no sales across both retail and warehouse channels.
*	Sales Channel Optimization: Liquor and Non-Alcoholic beverages performed well in retail, while Beer dominated warehouse sales.
*	2018 Sales Drop: A significant sales decline occurred in 2018, indicating a need for a strategic review of market conditions during that year.
### Recommendations
#### Improving Inventory Sale Management
* Stock Reassessment: Reassess stock levels for underperforming products like DUNNAGE and STR_SUPPLIES and consider discontinuation or repurposing to reduce overstocking.
* Stock Surge Planning: Increase stock supply for high-performing products like Beer, using machine learning forecasting models to anticipate demand surges.
* Low-Performing Products: Re-evaluate stock levels, pricing, and marketing strategies for products like STR_SUPPLIES and REF, and introduce promotions to boost sales.
* Automated Replenishment: Implement automated stock replenishment for popular products like Liquor and Wine to ensure consistent availability in retail and warehouse channels.
#### Improving Sales Performance Optimization
* Tailored Marketing: Create tailored marketing strategies for products like Liquor and Non-Alcoholic beverages in retail, and bulk-purchase offers for Beer in warehouse channels.
* Seasonal Campaigns: Capitalize on high-selling months with targeted campaigns, bulk purchase discounts, and seasonal offers.
* Dynamic Pricing: Implement dynamic pricing for top-performing products based on demand forecasts, and introduce discounts for low-demand products like STR_SUPPLIES.
* Prevent Future Sales Drops: Analyze the factors behind the 2018 sales drop and implement strategies to prevent similar trends in the future.
